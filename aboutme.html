                <dd>As a lower-level cabinet member, Tom Kirkman never imagined something would happen that would
                    catapult him to the oval office. When a devastating attack on the night of the State of the
                    Union address claims the lives of the president and most of the Cabinet, the Housing and
                    Urban Development secretary -- who was named the designated survivor in case of such an event
                    -- finds himself promoted to leader of the free world. Suddenly thrust into his new position
                    of power, Kirkman struggles to keep the country from dissolving into chaos and must adjust
                    to his new normal, unaware of what fresh horrors may await the United States.</dd>
